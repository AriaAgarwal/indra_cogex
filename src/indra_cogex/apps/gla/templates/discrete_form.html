            This application performs gene set enrichment analysis using
            INDRA CoGEx, an automatically assembled biomedical knowledge graph
            consisting of causal, ontological, and property relationships,
            as well as relationships representing data. Given a list of genes
            as input the application ranks and lists GO terms, Reactome
            pathways, WikiPathway pathways, as well as upstream or downstream
            biological
            entities (e.g., genes/proteins, small molecules, biological
            processes) with respect to the input genes. Ranking
            is based on the overlap between the input genes and the gene sets
            corresponding to each listed term (e.g., the genes annotated
            with a given GO term or the genes that are part of a given
            Reactome pathway). <i>p</i>-values are calculated using Fisher's exact
            test with different options available to adjust for multiple
            hypothesis testing.
